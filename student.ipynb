    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast-paced world of real estate, it's crucial for agencies to provide clients with precise information. Clients, whether they're looking to become homeowners or investors, rely on real estate companies for guidance on important decisions such as pricing, market trends, and property evaluations. To meet this need, real estate agencies can benefit from a sophisticated regression-based tool. This tool uses various property variables like the number of bedrooms, year built, floor count, living area, condition, location, and amenities to accurately predict property prices. By employing regression analysis, agencies can offer clients more precise pricing estimates, leading to better-informed decisions. Ultimately, this tool aims to improve client satisfaction, streamline decision-making processes, and drive success for real estateÂ agencies.\n"
